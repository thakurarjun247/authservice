# AuthService
Once of the most crucial microservice of the project freedom.

## run with docker
### for minor code change 
docker compose build authservice  
docker compose up -d

### for active dev  
just make sure all services are running in docker with the help of two commands up there  
stop authservice container in docker desktop  
run the app from ide it will connect to postgres container  

### for more thorough clean up
1.  **Clean up previous runs (stop containers, remove networks and data volumes):**

    ```bash
    docker compose down --volumes
    ```

2.  **Build  application's image (rebuilds from scratch, ignoring cache):**

    ```bash
    docker compose build authservice
    ```

3.  **Start application services (PostgreSQL and AuthService) in the background:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Check if your services are running:**

    ```bash
    docker compose ps
    ```

5.  **View your application's real-time logs:**

    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f authservice
    ```

## how to create users and access app on swagger
open
http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html

### signup
go to /signup under HomeController  
press try it out  
in the request body paste this, make sure the role is ADMIN if you want to see all users, later:

`{
  "email": "admin@admin.com",
  "password": "admin",
  "userRoles": [
    "ADMIN"
  ],
  "authProvider": "LOCAL",
  "userStatus": "ACTIVE"
}`

### login
go to `swagger-login` endpoint  
don't use `login` its deperecated  
enter username and password  
you are done.

### view all users
go to `/adimin/users` under admincontroller  
try it out



## curl for endpoints

### login
When you call /login, Spring Security is handling it internally.

Spring expects a form-data POST (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) by default â€” not JSON.

When you send JSON, Spring Security's default UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter doesn't understand it.
It is expecting form fields, not JSON fields.

curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "username=arjun@example.com&password=password123"

### signup
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/signup \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"email": "admin@gmail.com",
"password": "admin",
"userRoles": ["ADMIN"],
"authProvider": "LOCAL",
"userStatus": "ACTIVE",
"createdAt": "2025-04-26T00:00:00Z",
"updatedAt": "2025-04-26T00:00:00Z"
}'

### findbyemail
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8081/users?email=arjun@example.com"
### findAll
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8081/users"

## login flow on postman

Perfect plan! ðŸ”¥  
You're super clear â€” let's go step-by-step cleanly.

---

âœ… **First step:**   
Create user:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/signup \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "email": "JSG@Mahadev.com",
  "password": "Bhagvaan",
  "userRoles": ["ADMIN"],
  "authProvider": "LOCAL",
  "userStatus": "ACTIVE",
  "createdAt": "2025-04-26T00:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-04-26T00:00:00Z"
}'
```


---

âœ… **Second step:** 
**Login** and **capture the cookie** (`JSESSIONID`) into a cookie file:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/login \
-c cookies.txt \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d 'username=JSG@Mahadev.com&password=Bhagvaan'
```

- `-c cookies.txt` â†’ save cookies (JSESSIONID) in a file.
- Important:  
  Spring Security expects login form data as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,  
  so **no JSON here** â€” that's why the `-d` body is like `username=...&password=...`.

---

âœ… **Third step:**  
Now you are logged in (cookie captured).  
Time to **access the secured endpoint** by sending the cookie:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/secured \
-b cookies.txt
```
- `-b cookies.txt` â†’ read and send cookie automatically!
